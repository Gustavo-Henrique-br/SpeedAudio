here a step by step:

### step 1 - clone repository in your machine

in terminal use:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Gustavo-Henrique-br/chromeExtension_WhatsAppFasterAudios.git
```
### step 2 - insert into your browser

somes shortcuts to browsers extensions here:

[Google Chrome](chrome://extensions/)

[Opera](opera://extensions/)

[edge](edge://opera://extensions/)

> if your browser isn't in the list try BrowserName://extensions

You need access your browser extensions, activate the developer mode (usually is a switch button in the top)
and drag and drop your cloned folder.
